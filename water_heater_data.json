      "description": "200 Liters Bosch Indirect On Roof Indirect (Closed Loop) Solar Water Heater\nThe Bosch TSS 200 Thermosyphon system is a close-coupled solar system with the tank and collectors both mounted on the roof. As it works on the thermosyphon principle of rising hot water, a pump, and controller are not required, making this a simple and robust solution. As it is an indirect solar system, a heat transfer fluid circulates through the collectors rather than the potable water. This system is therefore ideal in frost or poor water quality areas. The system is also backed up by electric boosting.\nDownload 200 Liters Bosch Indirect On Roof Indirect (Closed Loop) Solar Water Heater datasheet here >>>",
